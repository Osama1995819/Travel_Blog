	. WSGI is a specification that describes the communication between web servers and Python web applications or frameworks.
	. A mediator is required for carrying out the interaction between the web servers and the Python application. So, the standard for carrying out communication between the web server and Python application is WSGI(Web Server Gateway Interface).

In case of no column (case of us adding a column), remove the sitedb, then go to directory where app is located, then type python, then import the db , that should be in __init__.py file, db = SQLAlchemy(app)
then , type db.create_all() , 

For above point, there should be a way in code to automate this, instead of us trying having to delete and redo again
